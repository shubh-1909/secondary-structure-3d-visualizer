# 🧬 Secondary Structure & 3D Protein Viewer

This project:
- 🧠 Predicts **basic secondary structure composition** (Helix, Sheet, Coil) from PDB residue types.
- 📊 Counts amino acid frequencies.
- 🖼️ Visualizes the **3D protein structure** interactively using Py3Dmol.
- ✏️ Lets you change styles (cartoon, surface, stick) to explore protein features.
